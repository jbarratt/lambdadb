# Serverless Database Experiment

So, [serverless databases are a thing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/).

It inspired a strange idea -- what if we could embed the database inside a lambda itself? A really truly serverless database -- at least as far as anything serverless is really serverless.

This is the code itself, I wrote more about the idea at [my blog](https://serialized.net/2018/07/serverless_db/).
